### Aim of Experiment 6:

Create an application that uses a text file to store user names and passwords (tab separated
fields and one record per line). When the user submits a login name and password through a
screen, the details should be verified with the text file data and if they match, show a dialog
saying that login is successful. Otherwise, show the dialog with Login Failed message.
